enoRMITy is a virtual digital student advisor for RMIT students as a web-­based Mobile app. Using IBM Bluemix as the platform we have scraped the public staff directory of RMIT's website. We used the scraped data for training by injecting it into IBM’s Watson­ based intelligence providing a natural language Q&A service which students can use to get advice on the go. For instance a student might ask “what is the phone number of the head of the business school?” The app will answer the question with the name and phone number of the appropriate staff member.
This application is part of a project completed for BITS (Buliding IT Systems - CPT111 - 2016 - SP2) for RMIT University by Anthony Rawlins, Jason McCuen, Patrick Connell, Kyle Burton, and Yosef Yitzchok.
